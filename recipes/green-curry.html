        <h3>Discover the recipe</h3>
        <p>One of Thailand's most popular (and famous dishes), Thai Green Curry is a dish worth learning to make at home. Deriving its bright green color from fresh herbs, it is often prepared fiery hot in Thailand with loads of chilis. Our recipe is relatively tame but it's easy to dial up or down the heat simply by adding more/fewer chilis when making the curry paste. Thai curries are distinct from South Asian curries in that they more heavily use fresh aromatics like ginger, garlic, galangal, lemongrass than they do dried spices. Our chefs have developed a dried Thai curry spice blend with all the typical Thai aromatics and dried spices so that you can whip up a fresh curry paste with fresh herbs in just minutes. The curry paste is briefly fried to further develop the flavors before adding coconut milk for a silky smooth sauce that will unlock beautiful aroma and layers of flavor.</p>
        <p>One of the best reasons to make this dish at home is because it is so easy customize it to use up whatever fresh vegetables and protein you have on hand. Double the batch of green paste and freeze for up to 3 weeks to easily make curry any night of the week. Our Thai green curry simmers chicken into tender bites. But it can easily be made vegetarian by using tofu, mushrooms, and just about any other veggie you want to throw in. Try it also with fish, pork, or shrimp.</p>

    <h3>Discover the recipe</h3>
    <p> This tom kha gai soup recipe (or Thai coconut chicken soup) is absolutely perfect. Rich and creamy yet tangy and salty, this Thai coconut chicken soup recipe is filling but light and positively bursting with flavor. The very best tom kha gai recipe I've ever made or tried. With Whole30, paleo, and vegan options, too. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon coconut oil</li>
        <li>half of one onion</li>

    <ol>
        <li>In a medium pot, heat the coconut oil over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, jalapeno or chile, galangal or ginger, lemongrass, and red curry paste and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes, or until onions are softened. Add chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Strain out the aromatics (the garlic, onions, lemongrass, and ginger) and discard. Add in coconut cream or milk, chicken breast (or tofu or shrimp), and mushrooms. Simmer until chicken breast pieces are just cooked through, then add fish sauce, coconut aminos (or coconut sugar), and lime juice, plus more of each to taste. </li>
        <li>Cook 2 minutes, then ladle into serving bowls and top with sliced green onions and fresh cilantro.</li>
    </ol>

# odin-recipes
A practice HTML website for displaying a few Thai recipes.

Created to demonstrate some newly learned HTML skills from the Odin Project Foundation chapters, including applying HTML boilerplate, creating elements using tags and providing furthur information with attributes, and using href and relative paths, among others.

Also, because I love thai food.
